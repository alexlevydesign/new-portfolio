                <h1>Designing a better way to find government data</h1>
                <p>As someone who has recently gotten into cartography and data visualization, finding good data can be tough — especially government data! While government data is very robust, expansive, and often times free and open for anyone to download, it can be difficult to find the exact government data you need for a project.</p>

                        <p>From my discussions with experts, I determined that the main audience who would most need a tool to help find government data would be people who have less experience with this type of data, such as <b class="VisualDesign">students, journalists, and community advocates.</b></p>

                                <p>I found keywords defined in legislation mandating the federal government work towards implementing open data standards, but also found hardly any mention of these keywords in agency testimony to Congress, indicating that there could be an opportunity to make government open data easier to find, since the government wasn't making much progress on it.</p>

                        <p>I talked to an immigration data expert who (half-jokingly) said that he thinks a license should be required to use government data. Even though he was joking, he said that many people use government data without thinking critically about it, leading them to make inaccurate claims and insights.</p>
                        <p>Simply making more data available in one place won't help people use the data correctly. So I revised my goal to not only design a platform to help people find government data, but also to help them use it correctly.</p>

                        <p>In a typical interface where a user can search for data, they are immediately shown the search results and filters together, without much or any explanation about what the different filters mean. Data newcomers might not know where to start, especially in the case of government data since different agencies and levels of government can collect similar (or even the same) kinds of data.</p>
                        <p><b class="VisualDesign">That is why I designed a step-by-step process for searching for data that guides the user in filtering by topic rather than by agency.</b></p>
